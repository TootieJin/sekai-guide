# General Advice

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that you don't have to strictly stick to these advices to start making charts. You can make charts in almost anything, whether something gimmicky, or making a visualizer _(basically impossible but looks cool)_ chart, as long as it doesn't violate [the publishing guideline](https://cc-wiki.sevenc7c.com/en/guideline), that is.&#x20;

## 1. TIMING. IS. VITAL!!

**Incorrectly timed charts will leave bad impressions for people playing your chart.** You must make sure that your timing is perfect before placing any notes.\
\
If you are in doubt about timing, please consult someone for help.

## 2. Consult official charts.

Always review official charts to get an idea of what you're gonna add if you're planning to make a decent, playable chart. \
\
For starters, it is recommended to observe and copy these charting patterns from official charts while allowing your creativity flow freely little-by-little. Many great charters have sharpened their skills at first by imitating others they admired, so there is no shame in doing that yourself.

## 3. Start with lower levels

Try to avoid songs which have tempo (or speed) changes or slow songs until you are more experienced in charting.\
\
We recommend that the first song you chart be something relatively simple. It should be a song that has an easy to hear beat. This way, you can get the hang of the most essential things, and that you truly know what you're doing when making charts.&#x20;

## 4. Please playtest your chart correctly.

If you're making a playable chart, **playtest in another player's perspective**. When playtesting your charts, you always know what's coming up and what to do next. The important thing to remember is that: everyone else doesn't. So, it is important to consider what the player sees and identify potential playability concerns.\
\
Also, **don't think the chart is FC-able until you playtest.** This goes the same for whether you can clear the chart you made or not.

## 5. Stop and rest.

Charting is a form of creative work, so you are bound to experience burnout. Take a break. Don’t force yourself to be creative when you aren’t in the right headspace. Remember, you’re tired for a reason — you need rest, so you might as well take it.
