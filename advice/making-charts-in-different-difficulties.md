## APPEND

APPEND is the 6th difficulty which features charts meant to be played with more than three fingers\*. The notes usually comes in a 4-lane formation, hold notes usually end with a trace note, and occasional cross-hand patterns.&#x20;

### Use different note types to determine finger placements

Place at least 2 different note types on a 3+ notes chord, this way the player knows what fingers to use with no guesswork involved when sightreading.\
\
Here, in the example below, it is obvious that you need to use 1 finger on the left hand to hit the short hold notes, and 2 finger on the right to hit the other.

### Cross-hand patterns: Make it fun

While cross-hand patterns can be done without crossing hands, it can be very satisfying to hit if it's made in a way that flows well. \
\
Experienced charters usually take finger's inertia into consideration when placing notes in the example below, so that each taps change hand positions in an natural way, creating that flow sensation.
