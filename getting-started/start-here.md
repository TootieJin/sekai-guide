To get started, you will need...&#x20;

* [Sonolus app](https://sonolus.com/) on your mobile device
* Chart editor on PC, preferably [MMW4CC](https://github.com/sevenc-nanashi/MikuMikuWorld4CC?tab=readme-ov-file#download)
* Optionally some knowledge of Japanese

There are different charting programs that are used to make Project Sekai charts.

* Charting programs in the "For compatibility" category is used for making charts to record in a real PJSekai client, which uses `.sus` file to render.

[MMW](https://github.com/crash5band/MikuMikuWorld/releases/latest) is intended for compatibility with official charts, meaning it is not intended for Chart Cyanvas, but you can still use it. However [MMW4CC](https://github.com/sevenc-nanashi/mikumikuworld4cc/releases/latest) comes with quite a few more features, which you can use in your existing charts without incompatibility. These features include colored guides, separate hi-speed layers and lane extension.\

You will also have to join the [Chart Cyanvas server](https://discord.gg/chart-cyanvas-1060525567797112832) on Sonolus to play your chart. This URL you use for accessing charts on Sonolus will be the same used to upload your own charts. More servers available in [Sonolus Discord](https://discord.gg/sonolus-696599620259807242), and more information about [Chart Cyanvas](https://cc.sevenc7c.com) and uploading on the [wiki](https://cc-wiki.sevenc7c.com/).
