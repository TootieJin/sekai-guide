**Audio issues (MMW4CC)**

Sometimes the audio sounds delayed or is off for MMW4CC. This is usually because the audio stops working when you're either being AFK for sometime or it's being used by some other application that closes the audio device for MMW.

To fix this issue:

* Find said other application that closed the audio device by looking it up in Task Manager, and forcing it to close by pressing "End Task" on the top.
* Restart your MMW.
